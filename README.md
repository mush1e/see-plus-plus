## 🎯 What Makes This Special

**see-plus-plus** isn't just another HTTP server — it's a deep dive into the fundamental technologies that power the modern web. Built entirely from scratch in C++17, this server implements the same architectural patterns used by high-performance systems like Nginx, Redis, and Node.js.

This project showcases advanced understanding of operating systems, network programming, concurrent systems, and protocol implementation. Every component has been carefully designed to demonstrate production-level engineering practices while maintaining educational clarity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The server implements a **reactor pattern** with **thread pool execution**, combining the scalability of event-driven I/O with the parallelism of multi-threading. This hybrid approach allows the server to handle thousands of concurrent connections while efficiently utilizing modern multi-core processors.

### Core Components

**Event-Driven Network Layer**: The reactor manages all network I/O using platform-specific event notification systems (epoll on Linux, kqueue on macOS/BSD). This single-threaded event loop can monitor thousands of connections simultaneously without the overhead of thread-per-connection models.

**HTTP Protocol Engine**: A robust finite state machine parser handles HTTP/1.1 requests with proper support for partial message assembly, header validation, and security checks. The parser correctly handles the streaming nature of TCP and assembles complete HTTP messages from fragmented network packets.

**Connection Management System**: A sophisticated connection manager tracks client state, enforces resource limits, and provides thread-safe access to connection data. The system includes automatic timeout handling and graceful connection cleanup.

**Thread Pool Executor**: Worker threads handle CPU-intensive request processing while the main event loop remains free to accept new connections and manage I/O. This separation ensures that slow requests cannot block the entire server.

**Flexible Routing Engine**: A high-performance router supports both exact path matching (O(1) hash table lookup) and pattern-based routing with regex support. The dual approach optimizes for common cases while providing flexibility for dynamic routes.

## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### Cross-Platform Event Notification

The server abstracts the differences between Linux's epoll and BSD's kqueue systems, providing a unified interface while maintaining optimal performance on each platform. This abstraction demonstrates deep understanding of operating system differences and careful API design.

### Memory-Safe Resource Management

Extensive use of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles ensures that network connections, file descriptors, and memory buffers are automatically managed. Smart pointers and custom RAII wrappers prevent resource leaks even under error conditions.

### Security-First HTTP Parsing

The HTTP parser includes comprehensive security validations including directory traversal prevention, request size limits, header count restrictions, and method validation. These protections defend against common web application attacks and denial-of-service attempts.

### Non-Blocking I/O with Graceful Degradation

All socket operations use non-blocking I/O to prevent any single slow client from blocking the entire server. The system gracefully handles partial reads, connection timeouts, and network errors while maintaining connection state consistency.

## 🚦 Current Features

**Production-Ready HTTP/1.1 Server**: Complete implementation of HTTP request parsing, routing, and response generation with proper header handling and status code management.

**Concurrent Connection Handling**: Efficient management of multiple simultaneous clients using event-driven architecture with configurable connection limits and timeout policies.

**Thread-Safe Request Processing**: Worker thread pool processes requests in parallel while maintaining thread safety through careful synchronization and resource isolation.

**Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error responses with proper HTTP status codes, logging, and graceful failure recovery. The server generates professional HTML error pages for better debugging experience.

**Resource Monitoring**: Built-in connection statistics, request metrics, and resource usage tracking for operational monitoring and performance analysis.

**Platform Optimization**: Native performance on Linux (epoll) and macOS/BSD (kqueue) with compile-time platform detection and optimization.

## 🛠️ Build and Run

### Prerequisites

The server requires a modern C++17 compatible compiler and standard POSIX socket support. Development has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+) and macOS (10.15+).

### Building the Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mush1e/see-plus-plus.git
cd see-plus-plus

# Build with optimizations
make build

# Or build with debug symbols and AddressSanitizer
make debug
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start the server (listens on port 8080)
make run

# Or run the binary directly with custom configuration
./see-plus-plus
```

### Testing the Installation

```bash
# Run the built-in test suite
make test

# Manual testing
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
```

The server will start and display connection information. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` or test the JSON API at `http://localhost:8080/api/status`.

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

The server supports runtime configuration through the main function parameters:

```cpp
// Create server with custom port and worker thread count
SERVER::Server server(8080, 10);  // Port 8080, 10 worker threads

// Configure connection behavior
server.set_keep_alive(false);      // HTTP/1.0 style connections
server.set_request_timeout(30);    // 30 second timeout
```

Connection limits, buffer sizes, and timeout values can be adjusted by modifying the constants in the respective header files.

## 🔍 Performance Characteristics

The server has been designed with performance in mind:

**Scalability**: The event-driven architecture allows handling thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource overhead. Connection limits prevent resource exhaustion under extreme load.

**Latency**: Non-blocking I/O and efficient request routing minimize response latency. Most requests are handled within microseconds of arrival.

**Throughput**: The thread pool design allows parallel request processing, scaling with available CPU cores. Worker thread count can be tuned based on workload characteristics.

**Memory Efficiency**: Careful resource management and connection pooling minimize memory allocation overhead. RAII patterns prevent memory leaks even under error conditions.

## 🛣️ Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for additional features:

**HTTP/2 Support**: The modular parser design allows for protocol upgrades while maintaining the same routing and execution infrastructure.

**TLS/SSL Integration**: The event loop architecture can accommodate encrypted connections through libraries like OpenSSL.

**WebSocket Protocol**: The connection management system can be extended to support WebSocket upgrade handshakes and frame parsing.

**Static File Serving**: A static file controller with caching and compression support would complete the web server functionality.

**Advanced Routing**: Path parameters, middleware chains, and request filtering could enhance the routing capabilities.

**Monitoring Dashboard**: A built-in web interface for server statistics and configuration would improve operational visibility.
